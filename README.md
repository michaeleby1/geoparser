# Geoparser

This script mines text for geographical place-names and plots their coordinates on a map. It is intended for use with historical documents and classical works so as to quickly visualize their "spatial footprint." For a comprehensive look at the inspiration, aims, and practical applications of this tool, please see [my post on Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/geoparsing-with-python-c8f4c9f78940).
